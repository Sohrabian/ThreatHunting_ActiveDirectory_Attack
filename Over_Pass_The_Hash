## Resource your Must To Read To learn Deep Dive Offensive Mindset from Scratch:
  -- Resource 01- Implementation DC-SYNC Attack in Practical Mode (Scenario Base)- 
        https://ravinacademy.com/learning-road-map/dcsync-attacks-introduction-and-detection/#toc-heading-2.
  -- Resource 02- Read HackingArticle.com (Kerberoasting Attack DeepDive/ Silver Ticket/ Golden Ticket Attack / Golden Certificate Attack / AS-REP Roasting and etc)

## PRE-Requirment Knowledge:
  -- PASS THE HASH (PTH) Technique is for "Local Privilege Escalation" for Creating Persistance.
  -- OVer PASS THE HASH (OVER PTH) is for "AD Directory Privilege Escalation" to Get The "KRBTGT" Hash via implementation "DC-SYNC" Attack. 
  -- DC-SYNC is for Abusing Domain Controller Replication and get Access to the KRBTGT.
  -- Golden Ticket is an Access the Application Service through Impersonate user account that does not exist in Domain. 
  -- silver Ticket is Compromise the password hash (NTLM hash) of a service account without 
      any communication with a Domain Controller and hence is stealthier than golden ticket attack (Bypass Logging From KDC and Actind Like GHOST).
  -- GrantedAccess values represent the permissions a process requests when attempting to access another process.
      Specifically, 0x143A is associated with advanced access rights that Mimikatz uses for operations such as reading sensitive information from LSASS.
      This value typically indicates permissions related to credential dumping techniques.

    | GrantedAccess Value | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | 0x1010 | Read access to process memory |
    | 0x1410 | Includes read and query information |
    | 0x143A | 	Used for more extensive operations, including credential dumping |
    | 0x1FFFFF | Full access rights, often seen in various exploits |
 
## For implementation Over_Pass_The_Hash We must having these conditions:
 Gaining Access to a users has Joined to the "Enterprise Admin", "Domain Admin", "Administrators", "DC Computer"
## Why these Group Are Important in " OVer_Pass_The_Hash "? Due To these GROUP have Conditions like:
Replicating Directory Changes (DS-Replication-Get-Changes)
Replicating Directory Changes All (DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All)
Replicating Directory Changes In Filtered Set (DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set) (this one isnâ€™t always needed but we can add it just in case)

## Detection Over Pass The Hash using SPL/SPLUNK Based on LogonType 9
index=wineventlog sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" AND Logon_Type=9 AND EventCode=4624 AND Logon_Process=seclogo 
| table _time ComputerName Account_Name EventCode Logon_Type Logon_Process

## Detection Over Pass The Hash When Touching "Lsass.exe"
index=wineventlog sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" AND  EventCode=10 AND  GrantedAccess IN ("0x143A","0x1010","0x1038") 
AND TargetImage="C:Windowssystem32lsass.exe" 
| table _time ComputerName EventCode SourceImage TargetImage GrantedAccess
