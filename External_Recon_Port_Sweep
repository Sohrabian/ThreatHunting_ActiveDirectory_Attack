## Resource - HackingArticle/understanding guide nmap scan firewall bypass

Scanning / passive :
to identify live hosts on a network
to identify open and closed ports 
to identify operating system information
to identify services running on a network
to identify Vulnerabilites 
to bypass IDS

Advanced IP Scanner and Bypass FireWall using TCP Flag
Advanced Ip Scanner
Anger IP Scanner 
Zenmap - [find Live host]
01- techniqu "ARP Ping Scan" way of :
nmap help | grep -i sn  > ping scan 
nmap -sn -PR  <destination_IP>   > for Host is alive or no
02- UDP Scanning based udp ping 
nmap -sn -PU <ip>
03- ICMP Ping Scnaning [-PE] means ping Scan ICMP ECHO Request 
namp -sn -PE <ip>
04- ICMP TimeStamp Ping
nmap -Sp -PP <IP>  --disable-arp-ping
05- ICMP address Mask Ping Scan 
nmap -sn -PM <IP> --disable-arp-ping
06- TCP SYN Ping Scan
nmap -sn -PS <IP> --disable-arp-ping 
07- TCP ACK Ping Scan / bypass TCP SYN Ping Using TCP ACK Ping
nmap -sn -PA <IP>  --disable-arp-ping
08- TCP ACK SCAN with Costume Destination Port
nmap -sn -PA443 <IP>  --disable-arp-ping
09- Bypass Firewall using XMAS Scan Based on FIN/URG/PSH
nmap -sX -v <IP>     	#if Send FIN/URG/PSH and Response include "No Response" equal "open Port"
						#if Send FIN/URG/PSH and Response include "RST" equal "port Closed"
10- FIN SCAN 
nmap -sF <IP>
nmap -sN <IP>

11- TCP ACK Flag Find Firewall using Scanning via NMAP 
nmap -sA <ip or range> 	# send "ACK" there is "No Response" there isn't firewall
						# send "ACK" there is "RST" there is firewall
						
12- there is an file in this path named "/usr/share/nmap/" named		
	nmap-mac-prefixes stored MAC Devices to return Result
13- Vulnerabilites Scanning using "Script" in /usr/share/nmap/ like:
	example: nmap --script os-nse <ip or range>
14- Port Scan using "Ip Protocol ping Scan"
	"IP Protocol Ping Scan" like ICMP, IGMP, TCP/UDP on TCP like HTTP,DNS and .etc
	example: nmap -sn -PO <ip or range>
15- TTL Base ACK Flag Scanning 
	if Return RST with TTL less than 64 port is open 
	if return RST with TTL Bigger than 64 port is closed
	example: nmap -sA -p 80 <ip>
16- Window-base ACK flag Scanning	
	Return RST with Window-size non-zero port is Open.
	Return RST with Window-size zero port is Closed.
	exmaple: nmap -sW -p 80 <ip>
### windows-size means that determines how much data can be sent before requiring
	an acknowledgment from the receiver.
17- For VOIP using SCTP Scanning Protocol in for-way-handshake
	example: nmap -sY -p 80 <ip>  #using Protocl SCTP
	## if Return INIT+ACK CHUNK prot is open		
	## if Return Destination onruchable port is closed
18- Port Scanning on IPV6
	nmap -6 <netbios_name or FQDN_Name>

## Detection
Splunk USECASE / PortSweep:
	index=network sourcetype="your_sourcetype"
	| transaction src_ip dest_ip maxspan=2s
	| stats dc(dest_port) as num_dest_ports by src_ip, dest_ip
	| where num_dest_ports > 100
	| table src_ip, dest_ip, num_dest_ports
