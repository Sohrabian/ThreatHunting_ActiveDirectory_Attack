# Threat Hunting 
EventID: 11 - FileCreate
Detection Based on Common Places malware drops during initial infection
Like: Startup folder, Temporary and downlaod directories.

EventID: 15 - FileCreateStreamHash
FileCreateStreamHash. There are malware variants that drop their executables or Configuration
settings via browser downlaods. This event is aimed at capturing that based on the browser attacking
a Zone.Identifier"mark of the web" stream.

# Detection 
01- event.code:15 AND file.name:invoice.one*
02- event.code:11 AND file.name:invoice.one* #Get the TimeStamped, this method is especially effective when browsers aren't involved in the file downlaod process.
03- event.code:3  AND host.hostname: W01  #to Get the "Source.IP Address" / network connection
04- source.ip:192.168.28.130 AND dns.question.name:* #Which DNS Address in name Resulotion
05- more investigate via Zeek_Log using "dns.resolved_ip/zeek.dns.answers/dns.answers.data" to find Hosting site' IP via Zeek*
06- event.code:1 AND process.command_line:*invoice.one*  #To identify timeStamp, again
07- event.code:1 AND process.parent.name: "ONENOTE.EXE"  #notic timeStamp
  and Read these field the result of above:
    process.command_line
    process.executable
    process.parent.command_line
    process.parent.executable
08- event.code:1  AND  process.parent.command_line:"invoice.bat"
    # And find the Process_id based on :
      processs.name refferer to "powershell.exe"
      process.args
09- process.pid:"9944"  and process.name:"powershell.exe"
10- Search by adding these fields like ( File.path, dns.question.name, destination.ip)
